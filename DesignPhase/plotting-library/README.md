Key features:
- has a React wrapper
- supports line chart, whisker plot, heat map and many more (16 chart types)
- svg and png export are possible
- under MIT License with 1 million monthly downloads
- original library has 11k stars on github, the React wrapper 850+
- zooming is intuitive and supported by default
- tooltips are supported
- clear interface to address the chart, lots of options to customize plot
