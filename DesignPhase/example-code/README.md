Add components inside to auto-generate a live UML diagram from the existing strucure.

The parser is alreay setup to generate the code from this **src/** directory and put the .txt file in the **generated-uml/** directory.

Notes on frameworks we want to use:
- React
- Redux (state handling)
- Jest (testing, also mantained by Facebook)
- Material UI (components, a lot of input components, in our experience better documented than Bootstrap)
- axios (API Calls)
